# Movie Selector

## Intro
For my final project, I decided to use the [TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) api to select two random movies for the user
based on user input criteria. I wanted to keep the layout simple and work on my ui/ux design as well as functionality

## Future Improvements
- [ ] better restart system
- [ ] Links to actual movie
- [ ] possibly switch to imdb api so that more information is available ie. genre, rating, date, actors.
